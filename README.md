## Download the repo and start the solution

Download the Repo

Open the Repo in a command prompt / terminal and run:

`npm i`

and then

`npm run dev`

Now your solution should have built and started in a browser.

Start small! In our opinion it's better to have something that works (one product or one attribute) and focus on the process and flow rather than having everything perfect from the beginning.

We promote iterating our solutions and help each other with the iterations so often our first lines of code in our solutions are just the staring point and could be seen more as POC (Proof of Concept) rather then production ready code.
